title: Welcome to my blog

Hello. My name is I-Chen Chou.

I'm currently a senior at Lynbrook High School.

I like many things STEM related, but competitive programming is something I really enjoy.
I started my STEM journey through number sense in 4th grade, and this has progressed into competitive programming.

I'm part of the Competitive Programming Institute as a live/video instructor. 
I encourage you to sign up for our CPI classes if you have any interest in programming. :)

I'll be updating the blog once in a while.

My default username is icchou233 on most sites (Instagram, Discord, Gmail, etc)
