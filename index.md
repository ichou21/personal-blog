Hello. My name is I-Chen Chou.

I'm currently a senior at Lynbrook High School.

I like many things STEM related, but competitive programming is something I really enjoy. I started my STEM journey through number sense in 4th grade, and this has progressed into competitive programming.

I'm part of the Competitive Programming Institute as a live/video instructor. I encourage you to sign up for our CPI classes if you have any interest in competitive programming and know how to write Java/C++. 

In my free time, I like reading random stuff and journaling about any of the random thoughts that come into my head. Because I journal too much, with inspiration from my friends, I have gone into blogging.
I also enjoy traveling if I have an extended break. My favorite places to go are Taiwan and Japan.

My default username is icchou233 on most sites (Instagram, Discord, Gmail, etc)
If you are to contact me on Discord, please identify yourself.
